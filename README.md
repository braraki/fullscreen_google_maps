fullscreen_google_maps
======================

Bookmarklet that gets rid of the junk on Google Maps, giving you a 'fullscreen' view

I used javascript to delete the header portion of the page, with its large, useless blank spaces and search bar.
I also deleted the footer at the bottom right of the page, and used javascript to 'click' on the arrow on the sidebar to close it.
Lastly, I had to resize the element that contained the map to fill up the whole window (since deleting the header leaves a blank space).
